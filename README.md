## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes employee attrition using the **IBM HR Analytics dataset**.  
The main objective is to identify patterns and key factors that contribute to employee turnover, and to provide HR with insights to reduce attrition rates.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** → Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- **Power BI** → Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard design, and visualization  

---

## 🔄 Data Preparation
Data was cleaned and structured in **Excel** before importing into Power BI:
- Removed duplicates and missing values  
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., Gender, OverTime, Department)  
- Created calculated columns (Age Groups, Tenure Buckets, Income Bands) for better analysis

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The interactive **Power BI Dashboard** includes:
- **KPIs**: Overall Attrition Rate %, Attrition Count, Active Employees  
- **Attrition Analysis by Dimensions**:
  - Age Group  
  - Department & Job Role  
  - Gender & Marital Status  
  - OverTime (Yes vs No)  
  - Years at Company (Tenure Buckets)  
  - Monthly Income Bands  
- **Dynamic Filters (Slicers)**: Department, Gender, Job Role, Business Travel, etc.  
- **Custom DAX Measures** for Attrition Rate %, OverTime impact, and Active Employees  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Overall Attrition Rate**: ~16%  
- **OverTime impact**: Employees working overtime have ~30% attrition vs ~10% for non-overtime employees  
- **Age factor**: Younger employees (<25) have the highest attrition rate (~39%)  
- **Department trends**: Sales and HR departments show higher attrition compared to R&D  
- **Marital status**: Single employees are more likely to leave (~25.5%)

## 📈 Business Value
The dashboard helps HR and management to:
- Identify high-risk groups for attrition  
- Understand the impact of workload, tenure, and demographics on turnover  
- Support data-driven retention strategies (work-life balance, career growth, targeted HR programs)
